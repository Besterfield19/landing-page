      <span class="quote">"Bog Life helped me locate a new, even more remote bog to call home after my hut and I were driven from our bog.  We had lived in that bog for 100 years when suddenly it was drained and turned into a theme park, leaving us bogless for the first time in our lives. I don't know where I would be without Bog Life in MY life."</span>
